"""Unified cleanup API for topic and user state.

Provides centralized cleanup functions that coordinate state cleanup across
all modules, preventing memory leaks when topics are deleted or users disconnect.

Functions:
  - clear_topic_state: Clean up all memory state for a specific topic
  - clear_user_state: Clean up all memory state for a user
